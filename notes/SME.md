# SME

<details>
  <summary>RFE-201964</summary>

  ## We need the business decission about:
  - The order/prefence in differents options:
    + Custom configuration
    + New ResourceCenterIntegration Enabled

  - This custom configuration is only at client level or we need this configuration at department, division, location and user level?

  ### If I understand correctly:
  - If the client hasn't custom configuration and hasn't New ResouceCenter enable the value of this link is the old value: **https://www.copyright.com/rightfind-resource-center/solution/rightfind-enterprise/**
  - If the client has Custom configuration the value is custom configuration
  - If the client has New ResouceCenter enable the value is New ResouceCenter address.
