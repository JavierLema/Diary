    + https://ccc.atlassian.net/browse/RFE-20330
      - Bill wrote this comment: "@Javier Lema Li√±ares @Juan Zurita Bobis @Manuel Garfia Sanz to review next week and determine if language character support is supported or not in RDL reporting". 
      - But I think that the problem is the error on reports. 7 reports contains wrong characters because encoding.
    + BUG's: 
      - https://ccc.atlassian.net/browse/RFE-20140
      - https://ccc.atlassian.net/browse/RFE-20183

        This bugs are the same "error". In my opinion, this is a FAD and we need a new improvement to provide HTML Support at own grids.
